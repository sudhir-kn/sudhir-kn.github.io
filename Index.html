                    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
                    <p>The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (<a href="https://uscis.gov" target="_blank">USCIS</a>) is an agency under 
                        the U.S. Department of Homeland Security responsible for overseeing the country's immigration system. 
                        Its primary role is to administer and enforce immigration laws, including the processing of various 
                        visa applications.</p>
        
                    <p>The H1B visa is a non-immigrant visa category in the United States that allows U.S. employers to hire foreign 
                        workers in specialty occupations. It is designed to bring highly skilled professionals from around the world 
                        to work in specialized fields such as information technology, engineering, finance, healthcare, and more. 
                        The H1B visa program helps address skill shortages in certain industries and contributes to the country's 
                        economic growth and innovation.</p>
        
                    <p>To obtain an H1B visa, an employer must sponsor a foreign worker by filing a petition with USCIS. The employer 
                        must demonstrate that the position requires specialized knowledge and that they were unable to find a qualified 
                        U.S. worker to fill the role. Additionally, the employer must offer the foreign worker a prevailing wage and 
                        comply with various regulatory requirements.</p>
        
                    <p>The H1B visa program is subject to an annual numerical cap, which limits the number of new H1B visas that can 
                        be issued each fiscal year. The cap for most H1B visas is set at 65,000, with an additional 20,000 reserved 
                        for individuals who hold advanced degrees from U.S. institutions. The demand for H1B visas often exceeds the 
                        available slots, leading to a competitive and selective application process.</p>
        
                    <p>USCIS plays a crucial role in processing and adjudicating H1B visa petitions. They review the employer's 
                        eligibility, the qualifications of the foreign worker, and ensure compliance with the relevant laws and 
                        regulations. The agency's decisions on H1B visa petitions can have a significant impact on both employers 
                        and individuals seeking to work in the United States under this program.</p>
                    <p>Analyzing USCIS's H1B employer data can provide valuable insights into the industries, companies, and job 
                        positions that rely on the H1B visa program, as well as trends in the program's utilization over time.</p>

            <p>With this chart, we can see that <i>The Office</i> never had an episode rate 6/10 or lower, and that there were multiple episodes that went above the 9/10 mark.</p>
            <p>Moving the cursor over the chart, we notice that Seasons 2, 3, 4, and 5 were regularly rated with the best episodes, with a decline in the second half of Season 6 and first half of Season 7. This is when Dunder Miflin was incorporated into Sabre.</p>
            <p>The back half of Season 6 has a spike in ratings as the show prepares for Michael's departure. Following Michael's final regular appearance, the show's ratings drop to their lowest scores, that is until the final few episodes of the series.</p> -->
